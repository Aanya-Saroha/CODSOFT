# Iris Flower Classification Project

This repository contains the Iris flower classification project completed as part of a data science internship at `CodSoft`. The project involves implementing machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Project Overview

The <a href = "https://github.com/kindo-tk/CODSOFT/blob/main/Iris_Flower_Classification/IRIS.csv">`Iris dataset`</a> is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing three classes of Iris species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. Each class has 50 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**

## Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 95.56%
- **Decision Tree Classifier Accuracy**: 93.33%

Logistic Regression slightly outperformed the Decision Tree Classifier in terms of accuracy.
